Getting Started 
===============

First, for local testing install the ``agrtool`` package using pip::
    pip install agrtool

Then, add ``agrtool`` as a dependency in the ``setup.sh`` file
required by Gradescope autograders. See the **Usage** section for
an example of how to use modules from the package within the
autograder.
